* Preparse make an options to call handlers in specfication-order.
  I.e. given 
     [  flag .. "a" ..
      , flag .. "b" ..]
   If the command line is:
    % foo -b .. -a
   we still process -a before -b
  How to consider options in this....?  

* Mutexes

* Partial orderings (e.g. must parse x after y)

* Index arguments (give them a positional ordering)

* Come up with a [String] example and [Int] example
   (has to be derived)


* Cleaner way of dealing with String than runtime hacking
(overlapped instances (with Read)? could we make it so
we provide default Read for all, but if user gives us
an instance, we prefer that insted?)

* Make the parsing algorithm pluggable?
